# Learn NumPy Tutorial

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy is widely used in scientific and data analysis applications due to its efficient handling of large arrays and matrices.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

## Installation and Setup
- Installing NumPy using pip or Anaconda
## Array Creation
- numpy.array: Create a NumPy array from a Python list or tuple.
- numpy.zeros: Create an array filled with zeros.
- numpy.ones: Create an array filled with ones.
- numpy.empty: Create an uninitialized array.
- numpy.arange:Create an array with regularly spaced values.

## Array Atrributes
- ndarray.shape: Get the dimensions of an array.
- ndarray.dtype: Get the data type of the elements in an array.
- ndarray.ndim: Get the number of dimensions in an array.
- ndarray.size: Get the total number of elements in an array.
- ndarray.itemsize: Get the size in bytes of each element in an array.

## Array indexing and Slicing¶
- Indexing
- Slicing
## Manipulating array shapes¶
- reshape()
- resize()
- flatten()
- revel()
- defining array shape
##Stacking
- hstack
- vstack
## Requirements To run the code examples, you need the following:

Python 3.x
NumPy library
You can install NumPy using either pip or Anaconda. Instructions for installation are provided in the "Installation and Setup" section.
